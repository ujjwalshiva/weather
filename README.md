# Weather App

This is a simple Weather App built using simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The code is readable and built with simple logic. I have used the Open Weather API to fetch Weather data based on Latitude and Longitude details. Click on the website link and access the tool. The UI of the app is simple, easy to use and also responsive on a wide range of devices. Please comment if there are any errors while executing the program.
